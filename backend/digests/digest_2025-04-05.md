#### 1. How Deep Do Large Language Models Internalize Scientific Literature and Citation Practices?

        The spread of scientific knowledge depends on how researchers discover and cite previous work. The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in the scientific research process introduces a new layer to these citation practices. However, it remains unclear to what extent LLMs align with human citation practices, how they perform across domains, and may influence citation dynamics. Here, we show that LLMs systematically reinforce the Matthew effect in citations by consistently favoring highly cited papers when generating references. This pattern persists across scientific domains despite significant field-specific variations in existence rates, which refer to the proportion of generated references that match existing records in external bibliometric databases. Analyzing 274,951 references generated by GPT-4o for 10,000 papers, we find that LLM recommendations diverge from traditional citation patterns by preferring more recent references with shorter titles and fewer authors. Emphasizing their content-level relevance, the generated references are semantically aligned with the content of each paper at levels comparable to the ground truth references and display similar network effects while reducing author self-citations. These findings illustrate how LLMs may reshape citation practices and influence the trajectory of scientific discovery by reflecting and amplifying established trends. As LLMs become more integrated into the scientific research process, it is important to understand their role in shaping how scientific communities discover and build upon prior work.

        Deep neural network (DNN) testing is crucial for the reliability and safety of critical systems, where failures can have severe consequences. Although various techniques have been developed to create robustness test suites, requirements-based testing for DNNs remains largely unexplored -- yet such tests are recognized as an essential component of software validation of critical systems. In this work, we propose a requirements-based test suite generation method that uses structured natural language requirements formulated in a semantic feature space to create test suites by prompting text-conditional latent diffusion models with the requirement precondition and then using the associated postcondition to define a test oracle to judge outputs of the DNN under test. We investigate the approach using fine-tuned variants of pre-trained generative models. Our experiments on the MNIST, CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and autonomous car driving datasets demonstrate that the generated test suites are realistic, diverse, consistent with preconditions, and capable of revealing faults.

        A Literature Review of Reservoir Computing.
  Even before Artificial Intelligence was its own field of computational science, humanity has tried to mimic the activity of the human brain. In the early 1940s the first artificial neuron models were created as purely mathematical concepts. Over the years, ideas from neuroscience and computer science were used to develop the modern Neural Network. The interest in these models rose quickly but fell when they failed to be successfully applied to practical applications, and rose again in the late 2000s with the drastic increase in computing power, notably in the field of natural language processing, for example with the state-of-the-art speech recognizer making heavy use of deep neural networks.
  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a class of neural networks with cycles in the network, exacerbates the difficulties of traditional neural nets. Slow convergence limiting the use to small networks, and difficulty to train through gradient-descent methods because of the recurrent dynamics have hindered research on RNNs, yet their biological plausibility and their capability to model dynamical systems over simple functions makes then interesting for computational researchers.
  Reservoir Computing emerges as a solution to these problems that RNNs traditionally face. Promising to be both theoretically sound and computationally fast, Reservoir Computing has already been applied successfully to numerous fields: natural language processing, computational biology and neuroscience, robotics, even physics. This survey will explore the history and appeal of both traditional feed-forward and recurrent neural networks, before describing the theory and models of this new reservoir computing paradigm. Finally recent papers using reservoir computing in a variety of scientific fields will be reviewed.
